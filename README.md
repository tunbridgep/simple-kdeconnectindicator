Very simple appindicator for KDE Connect

I wrote this because I wasn't able to get [indicator-kdeconnect](https://github.com/b4j4/indicator-kdeconnect) working.

This is simply 1 python file. Run it with `python indicator.py`

#Disclaimer

My knowledge of python is extremely limited. This is my first python project. It's extremely simple and only up here for posterity. I welcome pull requests!

#To Do

This needs an icon, and it needs to be built as an executable. I welcome pull reuqests for both of these.
